Migrate website and database with ease


Tool I hacked together, I edited the script to remove personal info
and add more variable flexibility. Has not been tested since.

otherwise relatively straightforward,
let me know if you have any questions or feedback. 

## RUN ##
sudo chmod +x Migrate.sh

sudo ./Migrate.sh
